## Slack App Setup and Permissions üîê

To use this tool, you need to set up a Slack app with the appropriate permissions. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app or select an existing one.

2. Navigate to "OAuth & Permissions" in the left sidebar.

3. Scroll down to the "Scopes" section and add the following scopes under "User Token Scopes":
   - `admin`
   - `channels:history`
   - `channels:write`
   - `chat:write`

4. Scroll back to the top and click "Install to Workspace" or "Reinstall to Workspace" to apply the new permissions.

5. After installation, you'll see a "User OAuth Token" generated. This token starts with `xoxp-`.

### Important Notes:

- Use the User OAuth Token (starting with `xoxp-`) in the `-t` or `--token` option when running the tool.
- If your token starts with `xoxb-`, it is a Bot token and not have the necessary permissions to delete messages from other users.
- The user who authorized the token must have the necessary permissions in the Slack workspace to delete messages.
- Be cautious when using these permissions, as they allow for broad access to your Slack workspace.
- Ensure you comply with your organization's policies and Slack's terms of service when using this tool.

## Usage Example

To delete messages older than 10 minutes in the channel `CFNN90G07`:

```bash
npx -y slack-message-deleter -t xoxp-your-user-oauth-token-here -c CFNN90G07 -m 10
```

Replace `xoxp-your-user-oauth-token-here` with your actual User OAuth Token.
